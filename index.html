<h1>No Comment Explanation and Information</h1>
<h3>I'm going to share more information about nocom here, the parts that didn't make sense to put into a Fit script.

This page is a start but I also might make a video series, or split it up into blog posts, or both, or just generally make it higher effort (such as including graphics / examples / videos / images / code / etc), so check back here later if that sounds interesting to you. I haven't done so yet because my focus has been on making sure that the Fit video is good and accurate and such. Edit: I started writing the wiki page here

Here's the -250k to +250k overworld heatmap at 4K resolution:</h3>
